# CCA-175: Chapter 4

### YARN Architecture

- YARN = Yet Another Resource Negotiator

- YARN is the Hadoop processing layer that contains Resource manager and Job Scheduler

- YARN Daemons:

  - Resource Manager (RM): runs on MN, global resource scheduler, uses a pluggable scheduler for different algorithms
  - Node Manager (NM): runs on worker nodes, communicates with RM, manages node resources, launches containers
  - Containers: allocate memory and CPU on a worker node, apps run in one or more containers, clients request containers from RM
  - Application Master (AM): one instance per app, runs in a container, requests more containers to run tasks

### Working with YARN 

- as developer: submit, monitor and manage jobs; use Hue, YARN UI, YARN CLI
- as admin: use Cloudera Manager
- YARN Web UI runs on RM host:8088 , provides more detail than Hue, no control, no configuration
- Hue Job Browser: monitor the status of jobs, view logs, kill jobs


### CLI

```
$ yarn application -list
$ yarn application -kill appId
$ yarn logs -applicationId appId
$ yarn -help
```

### Essentials

- YARN manages resources in Hadoop cluster and schedules jobs
- YARN works with HDFS to run tasks where the data is stored
- Worker nodes run NM daemons, managed by a RM on MN
- Monitor jobs using Hue, YARN Web UI, or YARN CLI

# CCA-175: Chapter 4

### YARN Architecture

- YARN = Yet Another Resource Negotiator

- YARN is the Hadoop processing layer that contains Resource manager and Job Scheduler

- YARN Daemons:

  - Resource Manager (RM): runs on MN, global resource scheduler, uses a pluggable scheduler for different algorithms
  - Node Manager (NM): runs on worker nodes, communicates with RM, manages node resources, launches containers
  - Containers: allocate memory and CPU on a worker node, apps run in one or more containers, clients request containers from RM
  - Application Master (AM): one instance per app, runs in a container, requests more containers to run tasks

### Working with YARN 

- as developer: submit, monitor and manage jobs; use Hue, YARN UI, YARN CLI
- as admin: use Cloudera Manager

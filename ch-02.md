# CCA-175: Chapter 2

### Hadoop Architecture:

- Cluster:  a set of machines. It provides storage, process & management of resources
- Node: a machine in a cluster
- Master: a node that manages work and data process
- Daemon: a program running in a node

=> Cluster = {Resources Manager + Process + Storage}

### Storage:

HDFS:

- FS written in Java, based on Google FS, sites on top of native FS, provides redundant storage
- Best performance increase with millions and large files
- Files are written once so no random write
- Optimized for large reads and streaming, so no random reads
- Split files to 128 MB by default, distribute at load time and replicate on multiple Data Nodes (3x)
- Name Node stores the locations of files and blocks

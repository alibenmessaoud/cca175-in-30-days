#CCA-175: Chapter 2 

### Definitions

Cloudera :

- Leader in Hadoop based service
- Provide support & consulting in Big Data

CDH: 

- Cloudera Distribution Hadoop

- Integrates Hadoop key projects

- Available under Linux distros 

CDH helps to:

- Process, analyze, serve:
  - Batch: Spark, Hive, Pig, Map  Reduce
  - Stream: Spark
  - SQL: Impala
  - Search: Solr
- Store:
  - HDFS: native FS
  - Relational: Kudu
  - NoSQL: HBase
- Integrate: 
  - Batch: Sqoop
  - Real time: Kafka, Flume

Hadoop: Scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant data storage, process and analysis

- Use cases: ETL, text mining, indexing, graphs, pattern recognition, prediction, etc.
- Helps to ingest data from datasources to store them in other datasources
- HDP Components: 
  - Process: Spark, MR
  - Resource management: Yarn, Mesos, Spark
  - Storage: HDFS, S3, Kudu

### Tools by domain

- Data storage:

  HBase inside HDFS or Kudu

  - Hbase: HDP Distributed Scalable NoSQL DB
  - Kudu: Distributed columnar (KV) storage for structured data, with sequential read is faster than HBase, works on native FS, inetgrates with Spark, MR & Impala

- Data ingest:

  - Direct file transfer: HDFS
  - Import from sources: Sqoop
  - Streams: Flume, Kafka

- Data processing

  - Spark: Large scale data processing
  - Hadoop MR 
  - Pig: Scripting for MR: generates low level MR Java code

- Data analysis & explore

  - Impala: Faster dialect SQL engine for interactive analysis based on HDFS, HBase, Kudu data.
  - Hive: SQL on MR or Spark, uses Hive QL (Look like Impala) for ETL.

- Search

  - Solr: integrated with HBase, HDFS, MR, Flume

- Other:

  - Oozie: Define dependencies between jobs
  - Hue: Hdp UX
  - Sentry: Security

### Essentials:

Ingest: Flume, Sqoop, Kafka

Store: HDFS, HBase, Kudu

Process: Spark, MR, Pig

Model data as tables for SQL: Impala, Hive

Explore: Hue, Solr

Protect: Sentry

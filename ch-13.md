# CCA-175: Chapter x

### Common Patterns in Apache Spark

- Common Apache Spark Use Cases 
- Iterative Algorithms in Apache Spark 
- Machine Learning
- Example: k-means

### Essentials

- Spark is especially suited to big data problems that require iteration 
  - In-memory persistence makes this very efficient 
- Common in many types of analysis 
  - For example, common algorithms such as PageRank and k-means 
- Spark is especially well-suited for implementing machine learning
- Spark includes MLlib and ML 
  - Specialized libraries to implement many common machine learning functions 
  - Efficient, scalable functions for machine learning (for example: logistic regression, k-means)
